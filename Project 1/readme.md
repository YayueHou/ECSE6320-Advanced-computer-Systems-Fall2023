# Cache and Memory Performance Profiling
## (1) the read/write latency of cache and main memory when the queue length is zero (i.e., zero queuing delay)
## (2) the maximum bandwidth of the main memory under different data access granularity (i.e., 64B, 256B, 1024B) and different read vs. write intensity ratio (i.e., read-only, write-only, 70:30 ratio, 50:50 ratio)
## (3) the trade-off between read/write latency and throughput of the main memory to demonstrate what the queuing theory predicts
## (4) the impact of cache miss ratio on the software speed performance (the software is supposed to execute relatively light computations such as multiplication)
## (5) the impact of TLB table miss ratio on the software speed performance (again, the software is supposed to execute relatively light computations such as multiplication)
