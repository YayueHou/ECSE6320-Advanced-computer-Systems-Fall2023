## SSD Performance Profiling
This is the Project 3 in Advanced-Computer-Systems-Fall2023.
### Instructions
This project helps to gain first-hands experience on profiling the performance of modern SSDs.

FIO is a storage device testing tool widely used in the
industry. Like Project 1, we should design a set of experiments to measure the SSD performance (latency and
throughput) under different combinations of the following parameters: 

1) data access size (e.g.,4KB/16KB/32KB/128KB)

2) read vs. write intensity ratio (e.g., read-only, write-only, 50%:50% and 70%:30% read vs. write)

3)  I/O queue depth (e.g., 0~1024)

### Quick Start

```
sh run.sh
```
